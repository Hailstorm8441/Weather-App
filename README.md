# Weather App

All of the files that actually are for the app are in lib

# How to set up the app on your machine:

Go to https://openweathermap.org/, create an acount, then go to pricing and click get api key under the free tier.
Once you have generated the key you can download the zip file in releases (assuming that you are on windows) and unzip and run the exe
After you have gotten in the app it should prompt you to input the api key, if it doesn't then just click the hamberger button and click set api key and enter it there.
After you have entered the key you are all set and you can start messing around in the app.

I also have built code to github pages and that can be found here: https://hailstorm8441.github.io/Weather-App-Website/
It is currently not working, but will be once I finish this repo.
When this does get working the app will be truely cross platform (exept for mobile)

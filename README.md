# Weather App

A weather app that pulls data from Openweather and displays it with the Flutter UI framework.

If you want to see the built code you can go to https://github.com/Hailstorm8441/Weather-App-Website/ and view it there (but it mostly looks like gibberish).

# How to set up the app:

Go to https://openweathermap.org/, create an acount, then go to pricing and click get api key under the free tier.

Once you have generated the key you can go to hailstorm8441/github.io/Weather-App-Website and use the app there.

After you have gotten in the app click on the hamburger and click set api and enter your key in the popup.

After you have entered the key you are all set and you can start messing around in the app.
